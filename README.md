## About the Project

### Idea

The Basic Idea of the Podcast Directory is to have an Overview of almost any Podcast that exists. It can help you discover new Podcasts or to find Podcasts based on your Search.

### Features

When you visit the Website you immediatly get the newest Trending Podcasts, so you can get an overview about what podcasts are relevant at the moment.
When you scroll down you get the newest uploaded Episodes from any Podcast. Furthermore you can see the Top-Podcasts from the Categories Film, Comedy, News, Games and Education.
And if you haven't found a fitting Podcast within those Results there are random Podcasts at the Bottom, which change every time you visit the Page.

If you do find a Podcast which you like, you can click it, which will bring up a sidebar with more information about the Podcast, a link to the hosting site of the Podcast and a function to add the Podcast to you Favourites which will be shown at the Top of the Page.

If you have specific Preferences for Podcasts you can Search for any topic in the search bar and discover a ton of Podcasts which fit your search query. Last but not least, you can even filter your searched Podcasts to hide or show shows with explicit Content.

## Background

This Project is my first entry for [DEVJAM](https://www.devjam.org), a 2 weeks competition about online Web-Projects.
You build a Project to a specific theme and you have to complete the goals. You compete against other Developers who are building the same Projects and at the end the Winner of the DEVJAM is chosen by a public voting.
